# NOTE: Not easily implemented by all libraries, but if the library supports it,
# we could redirect to this endpoint for improved caching?
# NOTE: The API should expose indexed blobs etc. so why couldn't it support a

# If we deal with blobs, why handle paths at all, like when writing? Just for
# disk storage? Is anyone ever really going to look at the storage? Yes, maybe.
# create links? But that would screw with content encoding any way (if enabled).
# So the use case for disk is to have everything else turned off anyway?
